# customer_samples

Files:
1. process_customers.py: 

This is my submission. The code expects all the input files in the current directory. The filenames are expected exactly as specified in the specification doc. 

The output files are suffixed with _SUBSET.CSV, namely
CUSTOMER_SUBSET.CSV
INVOICE_SUBSET.CSV
INVOICE_ITEM_SUBSET.CSV

To run:

	python process_customers.py


2. generate_data.py

This is a script I used to generate sufficient entries in input files to test. Running this script creates a large enough sample for testing.

To run:
	python generate_data.py
